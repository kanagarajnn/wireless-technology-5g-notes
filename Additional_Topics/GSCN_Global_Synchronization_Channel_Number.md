# **Understanding GSCN in 5G**

## **Introduction**
Global Synchronization Channel Number (**GSCN**) is a key parameter in **5G wireless communication** that helps the **User Equipment (UE)** efficiently locate the **Synchronization Signal Block (SSB)**. GSCN ensures that the UE searches for **SSB bursts** in predefined frequency locations, reducing search time and improving network acquisition.

This document explains **GSCN, its significance, calculation methods, and real-world applications in 5G modem software**.

## **What is GSCN?**
- **GSCN stands for Global Synchronization Channel Number.**
- It defines **possible locations for SSB bursts**, ensuring faster UE synchronization.
- **Unlike ARFCN**, which has a **small step size**, GSCN has a **larger step size**, allowing UE to search efficiently.
- GSCN values are **predefined per frequency range**, avoiding unnecessary scanning.

### **Why is GSCN Needed?**
- Without GSCN, the **UE would have to scan all ARFCNs** to find the correct SSB burst location.
- GSCN defines a **coarse grid** of **possible SSB locations**, reducing search complexity.
- It ensures that **SSB is properly aligned** with the channel bandwidth.

## **GSCN Frequency Ranges in 5G**
The 5G **NR GSCN values** are categorized based on frequency ranges as per 3GPP specifications:

| **Frequency Range (GHz)** | **GSCN Range** |
|--------------------|---------------|
| **0 – 3 GHz**      | **2 – 7498** |
| **3 – 24.25 GHz**  | **7499 – 22255** |
| **24.25 – 100 GHz** | **22256 – 32767** |

Each **5G frequency band** has an associated **GSCN range**, meaning a given GSCN maps directly to a specific frequency.

## **GSCN Calculation Formulas**
GSCN is defined using specific formulas for different frequency ranges:

### **1. Frequency Range 0 – 3 GHz**
```
SSB Frequency Position = N * 1200 kHz + M * 50 kHz
```
Where:
- **N** is a variable factor.
- **M** is selected from {1, 3, 5}.
- Some frequencies generated by this formula may **not align** with subcarrier spacing and must be adjusted.

### **2. Frequency Range 3 – 24.25 GHz**
```
SSB Frequency Position = 3000 MHz + N * 1.44 MHz
```
- **N** is a variable factor.
- **Step size = 1.44 MHz**, ensuring **alignment with 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 kHz subcarriers**.

### **3. Frequency Range 24.25 – 100 GHz (FR2)**
```
SSB Frequency Position = 24.25008 GHz + N * 17.28 MHz
```
- **N** is a variable factor.
- **Step size = 17.28 MHz**, ensuring alignment with **higher subcarrier spacing (e.g., 120 kHz, 240 kHz)**.

## **Understanding GSCN Step Sizes and Alignment**
- **GSCN ensures SSB locations align with subcarrier spacing.**
- Example: For **30 kHz subcarrier spacing**, **1.44 MHz step size** aligns with **4 PRBs**.
- **In FR2 (24.25 – 100 GHz), step size = 17.28 MHz**, aligning with **12 PRBs**.

### **Example: GSCN Calculation for n78 Band**
Consider **n78 band (3.3 GHz – 3.8 GHz)**, where GSCN values determine possible SSB locations.
- **Given GSCN = 15000**, we calculate:
```
SSB Frequency = 3000 MHz + 15000 * 1.44 MHz
              = 3000 MHz + 21600 MHz
              = 24.6 GHz
```
Thus, **GSCN 15000 corresponds to 24.6 GHz**, ensuring proper network alignment.

## **Why GSCN Matters for 5G Modems?**
### **1. Faster Network Synchronization**
- UE scans **only predefined GSCN locations**, reducing search time.
- Without GSCN, scanning all ARFCNs would be **slow and inefficient**.

### **2. Improved SSB Detection and Cell Search**
- GSCN **predefines where SSB bursts can be located**.
- Ensures that SSB is **aligned with PRBs**, preventing decoding failures.

### **3. Optimized Frequency Planning in 5G Networks**
- Network operators use **GSCN step sizes** to **optimize frequency allocation**.
- Ensures **efficient spectrum utilization** and minimizes **interference**.

### **4. Trade-offs in SSB Placement**
- **SSB in the center of the band** → **Better RSRP & RSRQ, but may disrupt CSI-RS.**
- **SSB at the edges** → **More continuous CSI-RS, but lower RSRP & RSRQ.**
- **Network planning must balance these trade-offs.**

## **Key Takeaways**
- **GSCN defines where UE should search for SSB bursts, speeding up synchronization.**
- **GSCN has a larger step size than ARFCN, reducing search complexity.**
- **Different formulas exist for FR1 (Sub-6 GHz) and FR2 (mmWave).**
- **Proper GSCN selection ensures efficient SSB alignment with subcarriers.**
- **5G modems rely on GSCN for fast network acquisition and optimized spectrum use.**
