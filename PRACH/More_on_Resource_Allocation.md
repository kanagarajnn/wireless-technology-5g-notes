# PRACH Time and Frequency Allocation

## Introduction

The **Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH)** is a crucial uplink channel used by the **User Equipment (UE)** to initiate communication with the **gNodeB (gNB)** in 5G networks. Proper time and frequency allocation for PRACH ensures successful initial access, synchronization, and connection establishment.

This document explains PRACH **time-domain and frequency-domain** allocations using 3GPP specifications, real-world examples, and practical applications in 5G networks.

## 1. PRACH Time-Domain Allocation

### 1.1 Understanding PRACH Configuration Index

PRACH **time allocation** is determined by a **PRACH configuration index**, which specifies:
- **PRACH format (Short or Long)**
- **Subframe, Slot, and OFDM Symbol Start**
- **Number of PRACH slots per subframe**
- **PRACH occasion duration**

> **Example:** PRACH Configuration Index 158 (as per 3GPP specifications)
> - **Format:** B4
> - **Subframe:** 7
> - **Start Symbol:** 0
> - **Slot Allocation:** 15 (for 30kHz subcarrier spacing)
> - **PRACH Occasion Duration:** 12 OFDM Symbols

### 1.2 Subframe and Slot Mapping

Each **subframe** consists of **14 OFDM symbols**, and PRACH must be placed in a defined slot.
- **FR1 (below 6GHz):** PRACH slots = 2 per subframe (for 30kHz spacing)
- **FR2 (above 24GHz):** PRACH slots = 4 per subframe (for 120kHz spacing)

> **Example:** If PRACH is allocated to **subframe 7**, for **30kHz subcarrier spacing**, then PRACH must be scheduled in **slot 15**.

### 1.3 Guard Period and Cyclic Prefix

The **Cyclic Prefix (CP)** and **Guard Period (GP)** ensure the PRACH signal remains free of inter-symbol interference. These parameters are essential for defining **maximum cell radius** and **timing synchronization**.

| PRACH Format | CP Length (Âµs) | Max Cell Radius (km) |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------|
| A1 (Short)  | 0.9 Âµs        | 0.9 km             |
| B4 (Short)  | 15.2 Âµs       | 4 km               |
| Format 1 (Long) | 684 Âµs   | 100 km             |
| Format 3 (Long) | 103 Âµs   | 14 km              |

## 2. PRACH Frequency-Domain Allocation

### 2.1 Message 1 (MSG1) Frequency-Domain Multiplexing

PRACH **resource allocation in frequency** is determined by the **msg1-FDM** parameter, which defines how many PRACH occasions exist in parallel.

| msg1-FDM | Number of PRACH Occasions in Frequency |
|---------|--------------------------------|
| 1       | 1 PRACH Occasion             |
| 2       | 2 PRACH Occasions            |
| 4       | 4 PRACH Occasions            |
| 8       | 8 PRACH Occasions            |

> **Example:** If `msg1-FDM = 4`, there will be **4 PRACH occasions** in parallel, meaning PRACH is spread across **four different frequency resources** simultaneously.

### 2.2 PRACH Occasions and SSB Mapping

The **PRACH occasion** is mapped to the **Synchronization Signal Block (SSB)**, defining how PRACH is associated with different SSBs in frequency.

| SSB-per-RACH | SSBs per PRACH Occasion |
|-------------|------------------------|
| 1/8         | 1 SSB over 8 PRACH Occasions |
| 1/4         | 1 SSB over 4 PRACH Occasions |
| 1/2         | 1 SSB over 2 PRACH Occasions |
| 1           | 1 SSB per PRACH Occasion |
| 2           | 2 SSBs per PRACH Occasion |
| 4           | 4 SSBs per PRACH Occasion |

> **Example:** If `SSB-per-RACH = 2` and `msg1-FDM = 4`, then:
> - Each PRACH occasion is linked to **2 SSBs**
> - PRACH is multiplexed across **4 frequency resources**
> - Total **8 SSBs** can be covered in parallel

### 2.3 PRACH Bandwidth Considerations

The **PRACH bandwidth** varies with subcarrier spacing and the number of allocated subcarriers.

| Subcarrier Spacing (kHz) | PRACH Bandwidth (MHz) |
|--------------------------|----------------------|
| 15 kHz                   | 2.08 MHz            |
| 30 kHz                   | 4.32 MHz            |
| 60 kHz                   | 8.64 MHz            |
| 120 kHz                  | 17.28 MHz           |

## 3. Real-World Example of PRACH Allocation

Letâ€™s assume the following **network conditions**:
- **Deployment:** FR1 (Sub-6GHz, 100 MHz Bandwidth)
- **PUSCH Subcarrier Spacing:** 30 kHz
- **PRACH Format:** B4
- **msg1-FDM:** 4 (Four PRACH Occasions in Frequency)
- **SSB-per-RACH:** 2 (Two SSBs per PRACH Occasion)
- **PRACH Configuration Index:** 158

### **Step-by-Step PRACH Allocation Process**
1. **PRACH Slot Selection**:
   - Subframe = **7**
   - Slot = **15** (since 30kHz spacing has 2 slots per subframe)
   - Start Symbol = **0**
2. **Frequency Allocation**:
   - PRACH is allocated to **4 frequency occasions**
   - Each PRACH occasion covers **2 SSBs**
   - Total **8 SSBs covered** in parallel
3. **Transmission Timing**:
   - PRACH transmission duration = **12 OFDM symbols**
   - Guard Period (GP) = **12.85 Âµs** (calculated using CP + Sequence duration)

With this configuration, PRACH efficiently covers all UEs while ensuring minimal interference and maximum synchronization accuracy.

## **Summary**
- PRACH time allocation depends on the **configuration index**, which specifies **subframe, slot, and start symbol**.
- **Cyclic Prefix (CP)** determines the **maximum cell range**, with **longer CP supporting larger cells**.
- PRACH frequency allocation is based on **msg1-FDM**, defining the number of PRACH occasions **in parallel**.
- **SSB-per-RACH and Contention-Based Preambles** define how PRACH is mapped to synchronization signals.
- **Bandwidth considerations** ensure PRACH fits within the allocated frequency resources while minimizing interference.

By carefully choosing the **PRACH configuration, timing, and frequency allocations**, network operators can optimize **initial access, reduce latency, and improve overall 5G performance**.
