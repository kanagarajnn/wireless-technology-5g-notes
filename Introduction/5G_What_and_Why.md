# Understanding 5G Standards & Regulations

## Who Decides the Rules for 5G?

When we talk about **5G technology**, there has to be a governing body that sets the minimum requirements for what qualifies as 5G. These rules ensure that different countries, operators, and equipment manufacturers follow a common set of standards. This is where **ITU (International Telecommunication Union)** comes into play.

### **What is ITU?**

The **International Telecommunication Union (ITU)** is a United Nations agency responsible for regulating communication across different countries. It ensures that wireless communications do not interfere across borders and sets the standards for various telecommunication technologies.

#### **Analogy:**
Think of ITU like the **Olympic Committee** that sets the minimum rules and standards for what qualifies as an official Olympic sport. Just as athletes must meet certain performance benchmarks to compete, technologies must meet ITU standards to be classified as 5G.

### **Who Are the Members of ITU?**
ITU consists of:
- **193 Member Countries**
- **160+ Universities**
- **Various Public & Private Companies** (e.g., Airtel, Jio, Apple, AT&T, NTT DoCoMo)

These members collectively decide on telecommunication regulations and global standards.

### **The Three Main Sectors of ITU**
ITU is divided into three major sectors:

1. **ITU-R (Radio Communication)** – Decides wireless communication standards, including 5G.
2. **ITU-T (Telecommunication Standardization)** – Works on developing global telecommunication standards.
3. **ITU-D (Telecommunication Development)** – Focuses on improving telecom infrastructure in developing nations.

For **5G**, the most relevant sector is **ITU-R**, which started the **IMT-2020 project** to define the minimum requirements for 5G technology.

## **What Are the 5G Minimum Requirements?**

The **IMT-2020** standard lays out the baseline performance metrics that a technology must meet to be called **5G**.

### **Comparing LTE Advanced (IMT-Advanced) and 5G (IMT-2020)**
| Feature | LTE Advanced (IMT-Advanced) | 5G (IMT-2020) |
|---------|------------------------|----------------|
| **Peak Data Rate** | 1 Gbps | 20 Gbps |
| **User Experience Data Rate** | 10 Mbps | 100 Mbps |
| **Spectral Efficiency** | Baseline | 3x Improvement |
| **Mobility Support** | 350 km/h | 500 km/h |
| **Latency** | 10ms | Less than 1ms |
| **Connected Devices** | 10⁵ devices/km² | 10⁶ devices/km² |
| **Network Energy Efficiency** | Baseline | 100x More Efficient |
| **Area Traffic Capacity** | 1 Mbps/m² | 10 Mbps/m² |

#### **Analogy:**
Imagine upgrading from a **regular highway (4G LTE)** to a **super-fast bullet train network (5G)**. The new system allows more vehicles (devices) to travel faster, with lower congestion (latency), and with better fuel efficiency (energy efficiency).

## **Who Builds the Technical Standards for 5G?**

While ITU defines the minimum requirements, the actual **technical specifications** for 5G are built by **3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project).**

### **What is 3GPP?**
3GPP is an international consortium of telecom companies, academic institutions, and industry experts that **develops detailed technical standards** for:
- **3G (UMTS, HSPA)**
- **4G (LTE, LTE Advanced)**
- **5G (New Radio - NR)**
- **NB-IoT & M2M Communication**

3GPP ensures that the specifications comply with **ITU-R’s IMT-2020 requirements** before releasing them as 5G standards.

#### **Analogy:**
Think of ITU as the **government** that sets the laws (high-level rules), while 3GPP is like an **engineering committee** that writes the technical details on how to follow those laws.

### **How Does 3GPP Work?**
- Members collaborate in **meetings and working groups**.
- They create **standardized documents** that define how 5G networks should function.
- Once a specification meets ITU’s requirements, it becomes an official **5G standard**.

### **Final Thoughts**
- **ITU sets the minimum global requirements for 5G (IMT-2020).**
- **3GPP develops the technical standards that comply with ITU's rules.**
- **Countries, operators, and equipment manufacturers follow these standards to ensure global compatibility.**

This structured approach ensures that 5G networks work seamlessly across different regions and providers, paving the way for global adoption.
