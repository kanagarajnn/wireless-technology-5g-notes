## Course Structure & Modules

This course consists of differnet topics that systematically take you from the **very basics to the most advanced concepts** of 5G Physical Layer.

### **Module 1: Introduction to 5G Physical Layer**
- What is the Physical Layer?
- The role of the Physical Layer in 5G
- Real-world analogy: **Think of the Physical Layer as the highway of communication, where data packets are the vehicles, and the scheduling algorithms are the traffic lights.**

### **Module 2: Fundamental Concepts**
- Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) & Pseudo-random Noise (PN) Sequences
- Zadoff-Chu (ZC) Sequences & Scrambling Techniques
- OFDM Basics & Subcarrier Spacing
- **Analogy:** CRC in data transmission is like a spell checker in a document â€“ it ensures accuracy before sending it forward.

### **Module 3: Channel Estimation & Equalization**
- How the system estimates the quality of the radio channel
- Pilot signals and reference signals
- Equalization techniques to improve reception
- **Analogy:** Just like Google Maps estimates road traffic, 5G estimates network conditions to ensure smooth data delivery.

### **Module 4: Resource Allocation & Scheduling**
- How resources are distributed among users
- Time-frequency resource grids
- Scheduler strategies for maximizing throughput
- **Analogy:** Resource allocation is like seat allocation on an airplaneâ€”ensuring every passenger (user) gets an optimal seat (bandwidth) without overcrowding.

### **Module 5: UE Multiplexing & MIMO**
- How multiple users share the same channel
- Beamforming and Massive MIMO
- Spatial multiplexing techniques
- **Analogy:** MIMO is like using multiple cameras in a live sports broadcast to capture every angle without missing any detail.

### **Module 6: Link Adaptation & Modulation Techniques**
- Adapting modulation based on channel conditions
- Coding rates and signal power adjustments
- **Analogy:** Like a music equalizer adjusting bass and treble based on the speaker system, link adaptation adjusts data transmission based on signal conditions.

### **Module 7: Advanced 5G Concepts**
- mmWave Communication & Beam Management
- Network Slicing & Virtualization
- AI & Machine Learning in 5G Optimization
- **Analogy:** Network slicing is like having separate VIP lanes on a highway for different types of traffic (emergency vehicles, public transport, private cars).
