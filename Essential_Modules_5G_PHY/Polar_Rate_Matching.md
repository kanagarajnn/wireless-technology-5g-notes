# **Rate Matching for Polar Codes in 5G Modem Software**

## **Introduction to Rate Matching for Polar Codes**

In **5G New Radio (NR)**, rate matching is crucial to adapt encoded bits to available transmission resources. **For Polar codes**, the rate matching process consists of three main steps:
1. **Subblock Interleaving**
2. **Bit Selection (Repetition, Puncturing, Shortening)**
3. **Bit Interleaving (Channel Interleaver)**

This ensures efficient transmission and improves the reliability of control channels, especially in **5G modems** handling various physical layer channels.

## **Rate Matching Process for Polar Codes**

### **1. Subblock Interleaving**

- The **output of the Polar encoder** is first passed through a **subblock interleaver**.
- The interleaving process follows a specific pattern as defined in **3GPP 38.212**.
- This method enhances **Bit Error Rate (BER) performance**, improving reliability.

#### **Example:**
If the encoded output is **32 bits**, the subblock interleaver reorders them based on a predefined pattern. The new positions help in better performance against burst errors.

**Real-World Use Case:**
- In **PUCCH (Uplink Control Channel)**, **subblock interleaving enhances reliability** for short control messages, preventing deep fades from affecting consecutive bits.

### **2. Bit Selection**

- After interleaving, the bit selection module **adjusts the number of bits** to fit available resources.
- This includes three possible operations:
  1. **Repetition** → If fewer bits are available, **bits are repeated** to match the required length.
  2. **Puncturing** → Drops the **first N-E bits**, where **N = encoded bits** and **E = rate-matched output length**.
  3. **Shortening** → Drops the **last N-E bits** to match the required size.

#### **Example:**
If **N = 50** and **E = 40**, the system either **punctures** the first **10 bits** or **shortens** by removing the last **10 bits**.

**Real-World Use Case:**
- **PDCCH (Downlink Control Channel)** often uses **puncturing** since not all control messages require the full encoded length.
- **PBCH (Broadcast Channel)** may utilize **shortening** to optimize broadcast efficiency.

### **3. Bit Interleaving (Channel Interleaver)**

- The final step is **bit interleaving**, which reshuffles bits before transmission.
- **Condition:** **Bit Interleaving (BIL) is only applied for certain channels** (PUCCH, PUSCH) but **not for PBCH or PDCCH**.
- This process enhances performance for **higher-order modulations (e.g., 64-QAM, 256-QAM)**.

#### **Example:**
For **E = 40 bits**, the bits are placed into a **triangular matrix** row-wise and then read **column-wise** for transmission.

| 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  | 10 |
| 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 |
| ...| ...| ...| ...| ...|

The final output is read column-wise: **1, 6, 11, ...** improving error resilience.

**Real-World Use Case:**
- **Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH)** applies bit interleaving to reduce burst errors, ensuring **better decoding at the receiver**.
