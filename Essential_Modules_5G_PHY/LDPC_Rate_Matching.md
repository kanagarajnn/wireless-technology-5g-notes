# **LDPC Rate Matching in 5G Modem Software**

## **Introduction to LDPC Rate Matching**

In **5G New Radio (NR)**, **Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes** are used for **shared channels**, specifically:
- **PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel)**
- **PUSCH (Physical Uplink Shared Channel)**

**LDPC Rate Matching** ensures that encoded bits are adjusted to match the available transmission resources efficiently. This process plays a crucial role in optimizing data transmission for high-speed wireless communication.

## **Key Functions of LDPC Rate Matching**

LDPC Rate Matching involves several essential functions, which are discussed in detail in separate sections:

### **1. Limited Buffer Rate Matching (LBRM) vs. Full Buffer Rate Matching (FBRM)**
- **LBRM**: Used when there is a constraint on buffer size, leading to optimized retransmission handling.
- **FBRM**: Uses the entire buffer, providing better flexibility for retransmissions.
- **Real-World Use Case:** In **smartphones and IoT devices**, LBRM is often used to minimize power consumption, while FBRM is used in **high-data-rate applications** like video streaming.

### **2. Redundancy Versions (RV) and HARQ Processing**
- **Redundancy Versions (RV)** control how retransmissions are managed in **Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ)**.
- **Four RV values (0, 1, 2, 3)** determine which part of the LDPC code is sent in each retransmission.
- **Real-World Use Case:** In **5G base stations**, HARQ with different RV values ensures reliable delivery of data even in poor network conditions.

### **3. Bit Interleaving for LDPC Codes**
- **Bit Interleaving** spreads bits across different positions to improve error resilience.
- **Used for high-order modulation schemes** like 256-QAM to enhance performance.
- **Real-World Use Case:** In **5G gaming and real-time applications**, bit interleaving reduces the impact of burst errors, ensuring a smooth experience.
