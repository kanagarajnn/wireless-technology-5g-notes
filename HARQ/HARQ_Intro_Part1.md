# **Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) in 5G**

## **Introduction**
Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) is a critical mechanism in 5G communication systems that ensures reliable data transmission. It combines **Forward Error Correction (FEC)** and **Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ)** techniques to efficiently handle retransmissions while minimizing delays and maximizing throughput.

---

## **Why is HARQ Needed?**
- **Reliable Communication**: In wireless systems, signal reception can be impacted by interference, fading, and noise, leading to decoding failures at the receiver.
- **Retransmission Mechanism**: When a receiver fails to decode a transmitted packet, it sends a **Negative Acknowledgment (NACK)** to request retransmission.
- **Efficient Error Correction**: HARQ ensures that retransmitted packets are intelligently combined with previous transmissions, improving error correction performance.

## **HARQ Process in 5G**
1. **Initial Transmission**:
   - The transmitter sends a packet of data.
   - The receiver attempts to decode it.
2. **Acknowledgment Mechanism**:
   - If decoding is successful, the receiver sends an **Acknowledgment (ACK)**.
   - If decoding fails, a **Negative Acknowledgment (NACK)** is sent.
3. **Retransmission & Combining**:
   - The transmitter retransmits the data.
   - The receiver uses **Soft Combining** (storing prior failed transmissions) to improve decoding.
   - Different **Redundancy Versions (RV)** are used in each retransmission to optimize decoding.
4. **HARQ Stop Condition**:
   - If decoding is successful, the process stops.
   - If it fails after a predefined number of attempts, the packet is discarded.

## **Types of HARQ**
### **1. Chase Combining (CC-HARQ)**
- The same data packet is retransmitted without modifications.
- The receiver combines signals for better decoding.
- Simple but less efficient than Incremental Redundancy HARQ.

### **2. Incremental Redundancy (IR-HARQ)**
- Retransmissions contain different sets of parity bits.
- More efficient than Chase Combining as redundancy is gradually increased.
- Used in 5G to optimize spectral efficiency.

## **HARQ in 5G Channels**
| **Channel** | **HARQ Usage** |
|------------|---------------|
| **PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel)** | HARQ ensures reliable data reception in downlink. |
| **PUSCH (Physical Uplink Shared Channel)** | HARQ enables efficient uplink transmission. |
| **PUCCH (Physical Uplink Control Channel)** | Transmits ACK/NACK for HARQ. |
| **PDCCH (Physical Downlink Control Channel)** | Informs UE about HARQ parameters. |

## **Why is HARQ Not Used in Other Physical Channels?**
While HARQ is crucial for data transmission in shared channels, it is not required for certain physical channels due to their nature and function:

1. **Synchronization Signals (SSB)**:
   - These signals are periodically transmitted for UE synchronization.
   - UE can always attempt to decode the next SSB without needing retransmission.

2. **Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH)**:
   - Used for initial access and timing synchronization.
   - If PRACH transmission fails, UE automatically retransmits using a pre-defined backoff mechanism.

3. **Physical Broadcast Channel (PBCH)**:
   - Contains system information essential for network entry.
   - The UE can reattempt PBCH decoding from the next periodic transmission.

4. **Reference Signals (DMRS, CSI-RS, PTRS, SRS)**:
   - Used for channel estimation, beamforming, and signal quality measurement.
   - These signals are not meant for direct data transmission, so retransmission is unnecessary.

5. **Control Channels (PDCCH, PUCCH)**:
   - Control information is transmitted frequently.
   - If PDCCH or PUCCH decoding fails, the system automatically adjusts scheduling without retransmission.

## **Parallel HARQ Processes**
- 5G supports **up to 16 parallel HARQ processes per user**.
- This allows continuous data transmission without waiting for previous packet acknowledgments.
- Multiple packets can be in different stages of transmission and acknowledgment, improving network efficiency.

---

## **HARQ Timing in TDD Networks**
- In Time Division Duplex (TDD) mode, HARQ retransmission is constrained by uplink and downlink slot structure.
- Delayed ACK/NACKs affect retransmission scheduling, requiring efficient HARQ process management.
- Uplink HARQ feedback is sent in designated **PUCCH or PUSCH slots**.

---

## **HARQ and Modem Software Optimization**
- **Adaptive HARQ**: Modem software dynamically adjusts HARQ parameters based on channel conditions.
- **Code Block Group (CBG) Based HARQ**: Allows retransmissions at the **code block** level instead of full transport blocks, reducing latency.
- **HARQ Aware Scheduling**: 5G modems optimize resource allocation by considering HARQ states of multiple users.

---

## **Conclusion**
- HARQ is a fundamental feature of 5G that **ensures high reliability, efficient error correction, and optimal spectral utilization**.
- By leveraging **soft combining, redundancy versions, and parallel processing**, HARQ enhances performance in both uplink and downlink transmissions.
- Future enhancements in **machine learning-based HARQ scheduling** could further improve network efficiency.
